 * The Schema Object allows the definition of input and output data types. These types can be objects, but also

 * For more information about the properties, see JSON Schema Core and JSON Schema Validation. Unless stated otherwise,
 * the property definitions follow the JSON Schema.

 * Alternatively, any time a Schema Object can be used, a Reference Object can be used in its place. This allows
 * referencing definitions instead of defining them inline.
